# Notes for maintainers:
# - This workflow builds the site from main and deploys only the static files to gh-pages.
# - Source code stays on main; gh-pages contains only the static site.
# - After first deploy, set GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages) to branch: gh-pages, folder: / (root).
# - All static files (manifest, icons, sw.js, etc.) will be at the root of gh-pages for correct URLs.
